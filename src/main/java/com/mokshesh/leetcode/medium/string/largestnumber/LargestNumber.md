## Problem Statement
Given a list of non-negative integers nums, arrange them such that they form the largest number and return it.

Since the result may be very large, so you need to return a string instead of an integer.

## Examples
Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [10,2]
Output: "210"
```

Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [3,30,34,5,9]
Output: "9534330"
```

## Constraints
- `1 <= nums.length <= 100`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`

## Hints

1. Convert each integer to a string.
2. Sort strings according to a special rule: if a+b > b+a, then a should be ahead of b in the final arrangement.
3. Join the sorted strings to get the final result.
4. Handle edge case where all numbers are 0.
