## Problem Statement
Given an input string `s`, reverse the order of the words.

A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The words in `s` will be separated by at least one space.

Return a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space.

Note that:
- `s` may contain leading or trailing spaces or multiple spaces between two words.
- The returned string should only have a single space separating the words. Do not include any extra spaces.

## Examples
Example 1:
```
Input: s = "the sky is blue"
Output: "blue is sky the"
```

Example 2:
```
Input: s = "  hello world  "
Output: "world hello"
Explanation: Your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces.
```

Example 3:
```
Input: s = "a good   example"
Output: "example good a"
Explanation: You need to reduce multiple spaces between two words to a single space in the reversed string.
```

## Constraints
- 1 <= s.length <= 10^4
- s contains English letters (upper-case and lower-case), digits, and spaces ' '.
- There is at least one word in s.

## Hints

1. First remove leading and trailing spaces
2. Then split the string into words
3. Finally join the words in reverse order with a single space
4. Alternatively, you can solve it in-place by reversing the whole string first, then reversing each word
