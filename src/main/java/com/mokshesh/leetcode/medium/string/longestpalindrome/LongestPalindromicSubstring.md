## Problem Statement
Given a string `s`, return the longest palindromic substring in `s`.

A string is palindromic if it reads the same forward and backward.

## Examples
```
Example 1:
Input: s = "babad"
Output: "bab"
Explanation: "aba" is also a valid answer.

Example 2:
Input: s = "cbbd"
Output: "bb"
```

## Constraints
- `1 <= s.length <= 1000`
- `s` consists of only digits and English letters

## Hints

1. Consider each character as a potential center of a palindrome
2. For each center, expand outwards to find the longest palindrome
3. Remember to check for both odd and even length palindromes
4. Use dynamic programming to optimize the solution
5. Keep track of the start index and length of the longest palindrome found so far
