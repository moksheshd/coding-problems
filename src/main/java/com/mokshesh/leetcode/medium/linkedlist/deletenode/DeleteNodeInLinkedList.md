## Problem Statement
There is a singly-linked list head and we want to delete a node `node` in it.

You are given the node to be deleted `node`. You will **not be given access** to the first node of head.

All the values of the linked list are **unique**, and it is guaranteed that the given node `node` is not the last node in the linked list.

Delete the given node. Note that by deleting the node, we do not mean removing it from memory. We mean:
- The value of the given node should not exist in the linked list.
- The number of nodes in the linked list should decrease by one.
- All the values before `node` should be in the same order.
- All the values after `node` should be in the same order.

## Examples
Example 1:
```
Input: head = [4,5,1,9], node = 5
Output: [4,1,9]
Explanation: You are given the second node with value 5, the linked list should become 4 -> 1 -> 9 after calling your function.
```

Example 2:
```
Input: head = [4,5,1,9], node = 1
Output: [4,5,9]
Explanation: You are given the third node with value 1, the linked list should become 4 -> 5 -> 9 after calling your function.
```

## Constraints
- The number of nodes in the given list is in the range `[2, 1000]`.
- `-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000`
- The value of each node in the list is unique.
- The `node` to be deleted is in the list and is not a tail node.

## Hints
<details>
<summary>Click here to see hints</summary>

1. You can't access the head node, so you can't traverse from the beginning.
2. You only have access to the node to be deleted.
3. Think about copying values instead of actually deleting nodes.
4. Can you make the current node look like its next node?
