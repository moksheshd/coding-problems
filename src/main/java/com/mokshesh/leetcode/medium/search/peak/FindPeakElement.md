## Problem Statement
A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.

Given a 0-indexed integer array `nums`, find a peak element, and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.

You may imagine that `nums[-1] = nums[n] = -âˆž`. In other words, an element is always considered to be strictly greater than a neighbor that is outside the array.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.

## Examples
Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: 3 is a peak element and your function should return the index number 2.
```

Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [1,2,1,3,5,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Your function can return either index number 1 where the peak element is 2, or index number 5 where the peak element is 6.
```

## Constraints
- 1 <= nums.length <= 1000
- -2^31 <= nums[i] <= 2^31 - 1
- nums[i] != nums[i + 1] for all valid i
- Time complexity must be O(log n)

## Hints

1. Think about how binary search can be applied here.
2. Since we need O(log n) time complexity, binary search is a good candidate.
3. Consider how you can determine which half of the array contains a peak.
4. If an element is greater than its next element, a peak must exist on its left side.
